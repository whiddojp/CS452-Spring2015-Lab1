Description:
Program is designed to generate and view a triangle using TRIANGLE_FAN, then generate a square using TRIANGLE_FAN while 
clearing the first triangle, and then generate the last shape using two TRIANGLE_STRIP commands. The points are all stored
in a single Float32Array and the visible shape is controlled by an iteration value (index) changed by clicking.
